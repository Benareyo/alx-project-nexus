# Project Nexus Documentation

## Introduction
Project Nexus is a key milestone in the ProDev Backend Engineering program.  
It serves as the capstone project where learners demonstrate their backend development skills by applying technologies, tools, and best practices to build a functional backend system.

This repository documents the major learnings, challenges, and solutions gained throughout the program.

## Objectives
- Consolidate key learnings from the ProDev Backend Engineering program.  
- Document major backend technologies, concepts, and best practices.  
- Provide a reference guide for current and future learners.  
- Foster collaboration between frontend and backend learners.  

## Key Learnings
### Technologies
- **Python & Django** – Core backend framework.  
- **REST APIs & GraphQL APIs** – Building modern, scalable APIs.  
- **Docker** – Containerization for deployment.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines** – Automating testing and deployment.  
- **Celery & RabbitMQ** – Asynchronous task management.  
- **PostgreSQL** – Database management and optimization.  

### Backend Concepts
- Database design and normalization.  
- Asynchronous programming and caching strategies.  
- API authentication, authorization, and security best practices.  
- System design and scalability.  

### Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Managing background tasks.  
  **Solution:** Implemented Celery with RabbitMQ.  
- **Challenge:** Efficient API documentation.  
  **Solution:** Used Swagger/OpenAPI for clear, testable documentation.  
- **Challenge:** Deployment consistency.  
  **Solution:** Used Docker for containerized environments.  

### Best Practices & Takeaways
- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.  
- Use GitHub effectively for version control and collaboration.  
- Follow industry standards for database design, security, and performance.  
- Prioritize teamwork, communication, and documentation.  

## Collaboration
- **With Backend Learners:** Share ideas, review each other’s work, and organize coding sessions.  
- **With Frontend Learners:** Provide and test API endpoints for integration.
