# 🪄 Project Nexus Documentation

## 📘 Introduction

**Project Nexus** is the capstone project for the **ProDev Backend Engineering Program**.  
It demonstrates backend development skills through the design and deployment of a functional, secure, and scalable backend system.

This repository highlights the **core technologies**, **learnings**, and **solutions** developed throughout the project journey.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Apply backend engineering concepts in a real-world project.  
- Build and document a production-grade backend application.  
- Implement clean code, security, and scalability best practices.  
- Collaborate effectively with frontend teams for seamless integration.
